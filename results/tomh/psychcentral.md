## Comments

Many questions are negative, which means when looking at a "Disagree" option, I must consider a double negative,
which could just as easily be expressed as a positive -- and hence easier to process -- if the question was positive.

The pandemic has me on edge.  I am trying to ignore this temporary state of affairs, because I am usually fairly calm.

Avoiding the middle, "Neither agree nor disagree" options, because I feel it is a total cop-out.
