## Comments

These questions are similar to, but still a bit different from the others.

**Note that it adds a sixth factor, **Honesty-Humility,** to the Big Five.**
Also, each of the six domains has only four facets, as opposed to six in the NEO-PI-R.

These are not the only ways this assessment differs from the FFM.  For more examples, see below.

Unlike any of the others, there were three awareness questions, which presumably did not count towards my scores.
These asked me to pick a specific answer, to make sure I was paying attention.

The bar graphs at the top of the results page, with the middle 80% highlighted, are very nice.

This assessment scheme replaces Neuroticism with the Emotionality Domain, which obviously links to Jungian emotions (Feeling).
The book by Costa and McCrae links Jungian emotions (Feeling) with Agreeableness.  Interesting.

They write "Agreeableness (versus Anger)" but do not use the term "versus" in any of the other domain names.
The measure of Anger falls under the Patience facet of Agreeableness.
In the FFM, Anger would fall under Neuroticism.  Interesting.

The narrative for Inquisitiveness, which I scored very high in, states high scorers like to travel.  **WRONG!**

At the bottom they include Altruism as an "Interstitial Scale."  Most people are more altuistic than I am.
Apparently some people may think I am a little hard-hearted.
