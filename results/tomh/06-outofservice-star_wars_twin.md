### How do I interpret percentile scores?

The percentile scores show you where you score on the five personality dimensions relative to the comparison sample of other people who have taken this test on-line. In other words, your percentile scores indicate the percentage of people who score less than you on each dimension. For example, your Extraversion percentile score is 5, which means that about 5 percent of the people in our comparison sample are less extraverted than you -- in other words, you are strongly introverted. Keep in mind that these percentile scores are relative to our particular sample of people. Thus, your percentile scores may differ if you were compared to another sample (e.g., elderly British people).

## Comments

These questions are of course similar to, but different from, the previous three quizzes.

Interesting, but I expected just one character, not five of them.
