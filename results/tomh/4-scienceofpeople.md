- Openness: "You are high open"
- Conscientiousness: "You are high conscientious"

### Narratives - copied and pasted from the results page

[Begin content copied-and-pasted]

##### High Open "Explorer"

If you are high in openness you love trying new things and having new experiences. You are curious and imaginative. You love coming up with new ideas and new ways of doing things. You thrive off of new! High opens often adventure and are usually the first to try something for the first time.

If you want to maximize your high openness, try:

- Signing up for a new activity every month — it will help you prevent burnout.
- Exercising your imagination and talent for coming up with new ideas at work or with hobbies.
- Finding an adventure buddy to help you exercise your high openness.

##### High Conscientiousness "Focused"

Conscientiousness describes your approach to organization and details. If you are high in conscientiousness you are very organized. You love details and don’t like to be unplanned. You are efficient and excel at to do lists. You might especially enjoy checking things off your to do list for a job well done! You are dependable, dutiful and a hard worker.

If you want to maximize your high conscientiousness, try:

- Loaning out your organization abilities to a colleague or partner in need — what comes naturally to you does not come naturally to everyone else!
- Volunteering to be the coordinator, scheduler, note-taker at work or in your activities.
- Exercising your talent for detail with the right kinds of hobbies and projects.

##### Medium Extroversion: "Ambivert"

Extroversion describes how you interact with people. People who are medium in extroversion are called ambiverts because they can dial up or dial down depending on the situation. You are very adaptable to people situations — if you need to be outgoing, you can be, but it is draining. You can also spend an entire day alone very happy and content — but three days in a row might be too many.

If you want to maximize your ambiversion, try:

- Finding the people who make you your best self. Ambiverts come alive around supportive people.
- Saying no to the people and places that drain you. The wrong social outings can be a source of dread for an entire week–just say no!
- See more tips for ambiverts in our [ambivert guide](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/ambivert/) here.

Special Note: If you are medium in many of the traits, try sending this Personality Test to someone else to take it as you. This checks your answers to make sure you are where you think you are!

##### High Agreeableness "Adapter"

Highly agreeable people are “yes” people. If this is you then you like to say yes to every request. You may even be a people pleaser. If you rate high in agreeableness you are likely friendly and compassionate. Highly agreeable people are also typically great team players. You are likely empathetic and very good at getting people to collaborate and cooperate. You might also be good at getting people to feel at ease, which makes it so people like to open up to you (and tell you their life story!)

If you want to maximize your high agreeableness, try:

- Do you struggle with being indecisive? This is because you want everyone else to be happy — make sure you are getting your needs met too.
- You are a great team player — and very good at supporting others and helping them. Leverage this super power!
- Learn your boundaries. If you are a people pleaser you can sometimes say yes to the wrong things.

##### Medium Neuroticism:

If you are medium in neuroticism, certain situations (or people) can set you off. You can get burned out if you sign up for too much. On a bad week, it is hard to fall asleep because you are worrying about all areas of your life. The good news is as a medium neurotic you can usually find ways to stabilize.

If you want to maximize your neuroticism, try: (!)

- Noticing your anxiety triggers. What turns a neutral week into a bad week? Stop the triggers before they start.
- Creating some self-care routines to prevent burnout from happening in the first place.
- Find low neurotic friends to keep you grounded.

Special Note: If you are medium in many of the traits, try sending this Personality Test to someone else to take it as you. This checks your answers to make sure you are where you think you are!

(!) I think they mean "minimize" not "maximize!"

## Comments

These questions are similar to, but different from, the previous three quizzes.

All questions start with "I see myself as someone who ..."

Gave them my gmail address to send the results to.  Also said it's ok to send some training materials to help me understand the results.

It seemed like they needed my email for the results, but they showed them to me online anyway.  Oops on them.

There were actually 45 questions, not 44, damaging their credibility.

Shared my gmail address to get the first chapter of her book for free.

### Ambivert?

Ambivert page is here: https://www.scienceofpeople.com/ambivert/

Took the Are You an Ambivert quiz here: https://scienceofpeople.typeform.com/to/mgXVnZ

And it says I am an Introvert (duh!):


You Are: An Introvert

Someone who gets energy from solo time and focuses more on internal feelings rather than on external sources of stimulation.

Etc.
