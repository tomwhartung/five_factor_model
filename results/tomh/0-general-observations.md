This file contains some general observations I have gleaned from answering these questionnaires.

# What Might Be Missing?

These are some things I have not seen in the others, that I might want to add to my version of the questionnaire.

- Rumination - Neuroticism
  - Dwelling unnecessarily on negative thoughts and encounters with others
  - This is particularly bad when there is nothing you can do about the situation
    - E.g., it is in the past or someone simply has more power than you do
  - I for one have a tendency to do this way too much!
