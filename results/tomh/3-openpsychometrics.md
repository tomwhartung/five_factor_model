Results of taking the personality assessment at:

- https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/

# 3rd Questionnaire

Going through these in the sequence in which they are listed in `questionnaires/list_of_questionnaires.md` .

That means I took this one third.


## Results

### Scores:

The graphic bar scales do not look right - Extroversion is short but all the others are about the same length!

- Factor I - Extroversion [Extraversion]: 13% (*)
- Factor II - Emotional Stability [Opposite of Neuroticism]: 84%
- Factor III - Agreeableness [Agreeableness]: 45%
- Factor IV - Conscientiousness [Conscientiousness]: 67%
- Factor V - Intellect/Imagination [Openness]: 59%

(*) "Extroversion" is incorrect, but presumably used widely by non-professionals:

### Explanations:

Trait descriptions:

#### Factor I - Extroversion [Extraversion]: 13% (*)

Factor I was labelled as Extroversion by the developers of the IPIP-BFFM. Factor I is sometimes given other names, such as Surgency or Positive Emotionality.

Individuals who score high on Factor I one are outgoing and social. Individuals who score low tend to be shut ins.

#### Factor II - Emotional Stability [Opposite of Neuroticism]: 84%

Factor II is labeled as Emotional Stability. Factor II is often referred to by other names, such as Neruoticism or Negative Emotionality (in these two cases interpretations are inverted, as Neruoticism and Negative Emotionality can be though of as the opposite of Emotional Stability).

#### Factor III - Agreeableness [Agreeableness]: 45%

Factor III is labeled as Agreeableness. A person high in agreeableness is friendly and optimistic. Low scorers are critical and aggressive.

#### Factor IV - Conscientiousness [Conscientiousness]: 67%

Factor IV is labeled as Conscientiousness. Individuals who score high on this factor are careful and diligent. Low scorers are impulsive and disorganized.

#### Factor V - Intellect/Imagination [Openness]: 59%

Factor V is labeled as Intellect/Imagination. This factor is also often called Openness to Experience.

People who score low tend to be traditional and conventional.

# From the About Page

This is fairly interesting.

**Note that they use open source questionnaires but at the end they request that people develop their own.**

## About this website

This website has been offering a wide selection of psychological assessments, mostly personality tests, since late 2011 and has given millions of results since then. It exists to educate the public about various personality tests, their uses and meaning, the various theories of personality and also to collect data for research and develop new measures. This website is under continuous development and new tests and information are being added all the time.

This website also exists for the promotion of open source assessments and open data. A number of open source measures of popular psychological constructs have been developed and are made available under a creative commons license on this website, see the full list. Also, at the end of every test users are asked if their data can be saved and used for research. The (anonymous) data that this yields can be downloaded from the data page. This data has been used in 25+ journal articles, see this list.

### Using the interactive tests

You are strongly discouraged from using any of the interactive pages on this website for anything other than one time personal use. This website is undergoing continual improvement and pages on this website may be updated or removed and scoring algorithms changed at any time. There have been several unfortunate incidents where people have been using a test of ours for a class project or something and the first email they ever sent us was about how changes to the website had ruined their project.

If you wish to use any of instruments here to collect data, please check the documentation or citation for the materials and implement your own survey. This will be strictly better as you will have more control over the data you receive and will provide a more seamless user experience.

## Comments

These questions are similar to, but different from, the previous two quizzes.

All 50 questions are very short, a single line, start with "I ...," and appear on a single page.

Clicking on the link to "the full list" of quizzes under development on the site takes you to:

- https://openpsychometrics.org/development/

This list is not as extensive as the one on the home page, but it refers you to the ipip.ori.org site:

- "For other open source measures, try the International Personality Item Pool."
- I.e., http://ipip.ori.org/

I will do that one later -- after the next one, scienceofpeople.com .
