For alleviating people's reluctance to answer such a long questionnaire:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This questionnaire contains 300 items but I want to try to alleviate any reluctance you might have in filling out such a long questionnaire.

o The items are not questions per se but rather short phrases and sentences.
o The items are very short:
  o They average 4.7 words in length.
  o There are 33 items with just 2 words.
  o The longest item contains 11 words, and there is only one of those.
o There is a middle "Neutral" option which the Jungian/MBTI questionnaires do not have, which makes things much easier.
o It's best to do them quickly, without thinking much.  Get on a roll and it can be hard to stop!
