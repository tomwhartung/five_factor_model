Asking People If They'd Be Willing to Help Me Out
-------------------------------------------------

If you want to help me out, you can fill out the open source Big Five OCEAN/FFM questionnaire I am using for the next phase of my art project.
It's a spreadsheet that I have loaded into Google Sheets, so you can do it in any browser, on a computer or even on your phone.  You can also download the google sheets app and do it that way.
One caveat is, there are 300 items -- and they're "items," like "Get angry easily" and "Demand quality" rather than questions per se.  Also, they're very short, averaging less than 5 words each.  If that sounds like too much, I have 50-item and 100-item versions, but they don't break the score down into the facets. (There are 6 facets for each factor, meaning it really tests for 30 traits, which is very cool.  I'm starting to think this questionnaire can identify a person's superpower....)
If you're willing to do that, please send me your email address, preferably a gmail address, if you have one of those.  Thanks!

For alleviating people's reluctance to answer such a long questionnaire:

Subject: About the Questionnaire

The questionnaire is open-source, so totally free for us to use.  I got it from https://ipip.ori.org/ , which is a site where you can download open source questionnaire items but cannot answer the questionnaires and get your results.  IPIP stands for International Personality Item Pool.

This questionnaire contains 300 items but I want to try to alleviate any reluctance you might have in filling out such a long questionnaire.

- The items are not questions per se but rather short phrases and sentences.
- The items are very short:
  - They average 4.7 words in length.
  - There are 33 items with just 2 words.
  - The longest item contains 11 words, and there is only one of those.
- There is a middle "Neutral" option which the Jungian/MBTI questionnaires do not have, which makes things much easier.
- It's best to do them quickly, without thinking much.  Get on a roll and it can be hard to stop!

If you're interested in learning more about the various ffm questionnaires out there, i wrote an article entitled "The Top Five Big Five 'OCEAN' Free Online Questionnaires," which is posted on medium.com here: https://bit.ly/mdm-t5b5 .

Thanks for taking the time to do this!
