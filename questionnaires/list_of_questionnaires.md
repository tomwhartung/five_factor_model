A list of Five Factor Model (FFM) questionnaires that I have found online.

# Annotated Links to the Questionnaires I Answered

These are links to the questionnaires I answered for my research into the FFM, along with my comments on each.

1. [psychcentral.com](https://psychcentral.com/personality-test/start.php)
   - 50 questions, should take about 7 minutes
   - Says it is similar to the MBTI but actually measures the big five personality attributes
2. [truity.com](https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test)
   - "See exactly how you score for [OCEAN traits] with this scientific personality assessment."
3. [openpsychometrics.org](https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/)
   - 50 questions, should take 3-8 minutes to complete
4. [scienceofpeople.com](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/personality/#personality-test)
   - 44 questions, should take about 10 minutes
   - Actually there were 45 questions, oops on them, but that makes more sense
   - This page has lots of helpful information about the Big Five traits and politics, teamwork, etc.
     - Also, facial recognition?!?
   - To take the quiz, click on the "TAKE THE QUIZ" button near the top
5. [personal.psu.edu](http://www.personal.psu.edu/%7Ej5j/IPIP/)
   - Found the link to this site further down in this list, [ipip.ori.org](https://ipip.ori.org/New_IPIP-50-item-scale.htm)
   - Contains two versions of the IPIP-NEO
     - New short version: contains 120 items, takes 10-20 minutes
       - http://www.personal.psu.edu/%7Ej5j/IPIP/ipipneo120.htm
   - **I feel the 120-item version is LESS accurate than the 300-item version, but some of the questions were rather redundant.**
6. [outofservice.com - Star Wars Twin](https://www.outofservice.com/starwars/)
   - Find Your Star Wars Twin, really just did this for fun
     - **Based on the Big Five traits**
   - Rather disappointed it matched each trait to a different character
7. [outofservice.com - Big Five](https://www.outofservice.com/bigfive/)
   - The Big Five Personality Test
8. [personal.psu.edu](http://www.personal.psu.edu/%7Ej5j/IPIP/)
   - Found the link to this site further down in this list, [ipip.ori.org](https://ipip.ori.org/New_IPIP-50-item-scale.htm)
   - Contains two versions of the IPIP-NEO
     - Original: contains 300 items, takes 30-40 minutes
   - **I feel the 300-item version is MORE accurate than the 120-item version, but some of the questions were rather redundant.**
9. [bigfive-test.com](https://bigfive-test.com/)
   - Found by following a link on the IPIP site - see below for details
   - 120 questions, "estimated to take you about 10 minutes to complete"
     - Very reactive - three questions per page, with a progress bar at the top that reflects every question answered - unique!
   - "Important!  Save the following ID to see the results later or compare yourself to others"
     - 5ec805799c0db30007ed2251
   - Permalink to results page:
     - https://bigfive-test.com/result/5ec805799c0db30007ed2251
10. [hexaco.org](http://hexaco.org/hexaco-online)
  - 100 questions, "usually takes about 15 minutes"
  - Includes Honesty
  - Taking the HEXACO-PI-R will cause your responses to "be combined with those of many other respondents and used for research..."

Results are in the `../results/tomh` directory.

**Note: I never pick the middle option because it seems like a cop-out!**

# The International Personality Item Pool (IPIP)

**I am thinking about using this as my initial FFM Questionnaire, and putting the questions in a spreadsheet....**

This content has been copied and pasted, with annotated links.

## From the "Site Overview:" Section

- "This is the official website for the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP)."
- "The items and scales are **in the public domain,** which means that one can copy, edit, translate, or use them for any purpose without asking permission and without paying a fee."  [Emphasis added.]

## From the "Warning about the nature of this site" Section:

- "BEWARE: This site includes highly technical scientific information, and NO PERSONALITY TESTS ARE ADMINISTERED HERE."
- "If you are looking to take an on-line personality questionnaire based on IPIP items, try the following site: [The IPIP-NEO](http://www.personal.psu.edu/~j5j/IPIP/)
  - **This links to site #8 in the list above, and is how I found it**
- "If you are looking for software to administer personality questionnaires based on IPIP items on your own computer, try the following site: [maccyber/bigfive-web](https://github.com/Alheimsins/bigfive-web)."
  - The link is to the "bigfive-web" repo on github, which is JavaScript code for the site [bigfive-test.com](https://bigfive-test.com/):
  - For details, see 'The "bigfive-web" Repo on Github' section below

From the "Are you not sure how to use the IPIP? A step-by-step, how-to guide" Section:

- "[Obtaining permission to use IPIP items and scales](https://ipip.ori.org/newPermission.htm)"
  - The questions are open sourced and it is ok for me to use them for any reason I want to whatsoever!  Yay!!
- "[How to format and administer IPIP measures, with a 50-item sample questionnaire](https://ipip.ori.org/New_IPIP-50-item-scale.htm)"
  - Contains suggestions on how to administer the questionnaire and 50 sample questions
  - This is not really a questionnaire that you can answer!
  - Again, **"the IPIP is in the public domain"**
  - **Spoiler Alert:** these questions are **keyed to + or - each of the 5 OCEAN traits**
  - **These are the questions I am thinking about using this as my initial FFM Questionnaire**
