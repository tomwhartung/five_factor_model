A list of Five Factor Model (FFM) questionnaires that I have found online.

# Annotated Links to the Questionnaires I Answered

These are links to the questionnaires I answered for my research into the FFM, along with my comments on each.

1. [psychcentral.com](https://psychcentral.com/personality-test/start.php)
   - 50 questions, should take about 7 minutes
   - Says it is similar to the MBTI but actually measures the big five personality attributes
2. [truity.com](https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test)
   - "See exactly how you score for [OCEAN traits] with this scientific personality assessment."
3. [openpsychometrics.org](https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/)
   - 50 questions, should take 3-8 minutes to complete
4. [scienceofpeople.com](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/personality/#personality-test)
   - 44 questions, should take about 10 minutes
   - Actually there were 45 questions, oops on them, but that makes more sense
   - This page has lots of helpful information about the Big Five traits and politics, teamwork, etc.
     - Also, facial recognition?!?
   - To take the quiz, click on the "TAKE THE QUIZ" button near the top
5. [personal.psu.edu](http://www.personal.psu.edu/%7Ej5j/IPIP/)
   - Found the link to this site further down in this list, [ipip.ori.org](https://ipip.ori.org/New_IPIP-50-item-scale.htm)
   - Contains two versions of the IPIP-NEO
     - New short version: contains 120 items, takes 10-20 minutes
       - http://www.personal.psu.edu/%7Ej5j/IPIP/ipipneo120.htm
   - **I feel the 120-item version is LESS accurate than the 300-item version, but some of the questions were rather redundant.**
6. [outofservice.com - Star Wars Twin](https://www.outofservice.com/starwars/)
   - Find Your Star Wars Twin, really just did this for fun
     - **Based on the Big Five traits**
   - Rather disappointed it matched each trait to a different character
7. [outofservice.com - Big Five](https://www.outofservice.com/bigfive/)
   - The Big Five Personality Test
8. [personal.psu.edu](http://www.personal.psu.edu/%7Ej5j/IPIP/)
   - Found the link to this site further down in this list, [ipip.ori.org](https://ipip.ori.org/New_IPIP-50-item-scale.htm)
   - Contains two versions of the IPIP-NEO
     - Original: contains 300 items, takes 30-40 minutes
   - **I feel the 300-item version is MORE accurate than the 120-item version, but some of the questions were rather redundant.**
9. [bigfive-test.com](https://bigfive-test.com/)
   - Found by following a link on the IPIP site - see below for details
10. [hexaco.org](http://hexaco.org/hexaco-online)
  - 100 questions, "usually takes about 15 minutes"
  - Includes Honesty
  - Taking the HEXACO-PI-R will cause your responses to "be combined with those of many other respondents and used for research..."

Results are in the `../results/tomh` directory.

# The International Personality Item Pool (IPIP)

**I am thinking about using this as my initial FFM Questionnaire, and putting the questions in a spreadsheet....**

## From the "Site Overview:" Section

- "This is the official website for the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP)."
- "The items and scales are in the public domain, which means that one can copy, edit, translate, or use them for any purpose without asking permission and without paying a fee."

## From the "Warning about the nature of this site" Section:

- "BEWARE: This site includes highly technical scientific information, and NO PERSONALITY TESTS ARE ADMINISTERED HERE."
- "If you are looking to take an on-line personality questionnaire based on IPIP items, try the following site: [The IPIP-NEO](http://www.personal.psu.edu/~j5j/IPIP/)
  - This links to the site in #8 above, and is how I found it
- "If you are looking for software to administer personality questionnaires based on IPIP items on your own computer, try the following site: [maccyber/bigfive-web](https://github.com/Alheimsins/bigfive-web)."
  - The link is to the "bigfive-web" repo on github, which is JavaScript code for the site [bigfive-test.com](https://bigfive-test.com/):
  - From the README.md:
    - "Website for five factor model of personality based on work from [IPIP-NEO-PI](https://github.com/kholia/IPIP-NEO-PI)"
    - "See it live @ [bigfive-test.com](https://bigfive-test.com/)"
    - The dates on the files and directories run from 2 years ago to yesterday
    - "Written in nodejs using next.js and micro framework"
    - The "IPIP-NEO-IP" link takes you to this repo: [github.com/kholia/IPIP-NEO-PI](https://github.com/kholia/IPIP-NEO-PI)
      - This site contains instructions to install the code on Windows and run with python2(!)
      - Files and directories are all dated 5-7 years ago(!)

From the "How to format and administer IPIP measures, with a 50-item sample questionnaire" item:

- The link takes you to [ipip.ori.org/New_IPIP-50-item-scale.htm](https://ipip.ori.org/New_IPIP-50-item-scale.htm)
  - It lists 50 sample questions
  - This is not really a questionnaire that you can answer!
  - "the IPIP is in the public domain"
  - **Spoiler Alert:** these questions are **keyed to + or - each of the 5 OCEAN traits**

# The Real NEO PI-R

It costs $92.00 and can be found here:

- [The real NEO PI-R](https://www.parinc.com/Products/Pkey/276)

Also, they require some sort of psych degree to adminster it!

# Other Interesting and Fun Questionnaires

The home page for this site has a bunch of interesting quizzes, including a self-esteem questionnaire,
the DISC, Cattell's 16PF assessment, the Dark Triad, and more:
