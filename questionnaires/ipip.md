Information about the International Personality Item Pool website.

# The International Personality Item Pool (IPIP)

**I am thinking about using this as my initial FFM Questionnaire, and putting the questions in a spreadsheet....**

This content has been copied and pasted, with annotated links.

## From the "Site Overview:" Section

- "This is the official website for the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP)."
- "The items and scales are **in the public domain,** which means that one can copy, edit, translate, or use them for any purpose without asking permission and without paying a fee."  [Emphasis added.]

## From the "Warning about the nature of this site" Section:

- "BEWARE: This site includes highly technical scientific information, and NO PERSONALITY TESTS ARE ADMINISTERED HERE."
- "If you are looking to take an on-line personality questionnaire based on IPIP items, try the following site: [The IPIP-NEO](http://www.personal.psu.edu/~j5j/IPIP/)
  - **This links to site #8 in the list above, and is how I found it**
- "If you are looking for software to administer personality questionnaires based on IPIP items on your own computer, try the following site: [maccyber/bigfive-web](https://github.com/Alheimsins/bigfive-web)."
  - The link is to the "bigfive-web" repo on github, which is JavaScript code for the site [bigfive-test.com](https://bigfive-test.com/):
  - For details, see 'The "bigfive-web" Repo on Github' section below

From the "Are you not sure how to use the IPIP? A step-by-step, how-to guide" Section:

- "[Obtaining permission to use IPIP items and scales](https://ipip.ori.org/newPermission.htm)"
  - The questions are open sourced and it is ok for me to use them for any reason I want to whatsoever!  Yay!!
- "[How to format and administer IPIP measures, with a 50-item sample questionnaire](https://ipip.ori.org/New_IPIP-50-item-scale.htm)"
  - Contains suggestions on how to administer the questionnaire and 50 sample questions
  - This is not really a questionnaire that you can answer!
  - Again, **"the IPIP is in the public domain"**
  - **Spoiler Alert:** these questions are **keyed to + or - each of the 5 OCEAN traits**
  - **These are the questions I am thinking about using this as my initial FFM Questionnaire**
