My current thinking is that a person's most extreme scores can reveal their super power.  I believe I told you on Fb that this theory is a twist on the "conventional wisdom" that extremes can be pathological.  Based on my analysis, DJT has very little Agreeableness, and was extremely low in the Cooperation (2%) and Modesty and Humility (5%) facets, yet he's managed to parlay those pathologies into an asset -- as the Bulwark people claim, it's like his superpower!
