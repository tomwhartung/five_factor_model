Why I Hate Social Media: An FFM Approach

As someone who is high in Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness, social media can be like hell.

I want to be open to everyone.
And I want to agree with everyone, or at least understand their point of view.

Few people are as conscientious as I am.

Most everyone thinks that people, in general, are less Agreeable, Conscientious, and Agreeable than I am.
I.e., pretty much everyone who doesn't know me will think I am just another asshole.
And I really really hate it when what I say is misunderstood as or twisted into something saying negative that I did not and would never intend.

Being open, sooner or later someone, a connection or "friend," is going to do something
I do not like - something impulsive, i.e. the opposite of conscientious.

Being agreeable, I dare not say anything.

I believe strongly that one should strive to never ever post anything negative online, because it's there forever.

Even when I do relent to posting something negative, if it is not well-grounded moralistically, I will feel guilty about it.

So it's best to just stay off it.

After all, as Cal Newport points out in his book So Good They Can't Ignore You, social media is just like a slot machine,
giving users of it unpredictable variable rewards.

Plus, it totally destroys my ability to concentrate.

When there is any kind of problem, I will want to fix it.
But I can never say anything negative.
So it just swirls around and around in my head, making it impossible to think.

So that is why I hate social media!
