Why the MBTI (r) Is Like the Fox News of Personality Assessments

Unused ideas:

[Bold]
The reason the MBTI (r) is like Fox News is it divides people.
[Unbold]

It's ironic that the large majority of the classic Films Noir were shot in black-and-white!
But that is another story completely.

Two notable exceptions to this world view might be Jesus and Satan -- "might be."
I for one try to refrain from judging others too quickly, because doing so distorts things.
Refraining can be extremely difficult -- and certainly easier for some than it is for others --  but I assure it is well worth the trouble!

As Melinda Potter says at the end of her answer on quora:

[start quote]
Not going to lie. There’s a part of me that wishes to still be able to live in that littler, simple, happier, easier, and comforting little bubble [Fox News] I once enjoyed. But, truth, with all it’s complexity, and unanswered important questions is so much more important to me than comfort.
[end quote]

It's tempting to look at only a fragment of what is visible on the surface, but at best that provides an incomplete view.

Agreeable types like myself find it is much easier to empathize with other people once one understands their motivations.
Disagreeable folks will probably not want to bother.  As the Bob Marley song goes,
"Who the Cap Fits, let them wear it." https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3lT1CivkLo

I have no wish to denigrate Jung's insights - which are truly remarkable - or the work of the Myers-Briggs family.
I only want to point out that, when it comes to personality assessments, there is now a better alternative.

Freeing Oneself From Plato's Cave

To drive home the point -- and perhaps connect with conservatives whose goal is to be as free as possible -- I will mention
seeing a parallel here with
Plato's Cave. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave

This quote from a page at Stanford.edu sums it up very nicely:

[start quote]
Seated prisoners, chained so that they cannot move their heads, stare at a cave wall on which are projected images. These images are cast from carved figures illuminated by a fire and carried by people on a parapet above and behind the prisoners. A prisoner is loosed from his chains. First he sees the carved images and the fire. Then he is led out of the cave into ‘the real’ world. Blinded by the light of the sun, he cannot look at the trees, rocks and animals around him, but instead looks at the shadows and reflections (in water) cast by those objects. As he becomes acclimatized, he turns his gaze to those objects and finally, fully acclimatized, he looks to the source of illumination, the sun itself.
From "13. Sun, Line and Cave"

Again, Bob Marley nails it in
Redemption Song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yv5xonFSC4c
"Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery, none but ourselves can free our minds."

Bob's music has been very comforting to me here in these troubled times of late May, 2020, what with the riots and all.

Hello, My Name Is Tom Hartung

Hello, my name is Tom Hartung, and I want to help others see past the surface.

Since the late 1980s I have been using the results of a questionnaire similar to the MBTI (r) to draw images of personalities.
I have a program that uses the results of any questionnaire based on the Jungian Archetypes to produce an image.

My favorite questionnaire is the
Keirsey Temperament Sorter, https://keirsey.com/temperament-overview/
but there are online versions, such as the one at
humanmetrics.com, http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/jtypes2.asp
that are arguably just as good.

As you can see from my sites,
artsyvisions.com https://www.artsyvisions.com/
seeourminds.com https://www.seeourminds.com/
and
groja.com https://www.groja.com/
these images are crude.

Now that I am retired from corporate work and can spend all my energy on this project,
this year I decided to step my game up and learn about the Big Five "OCEAN" personality types.

Compared to the MBTI (r), the Five Factor Model is a real eye-opener!
So far I have read three books about it, and it has changed my outlook on life big time!

Goodreads Review of Personality: What Makes You the Way You Are by Daniel Nettle https://bit.ly/gr-nettle
Goodreads Review of Jesus Personality Theory: Exploring the Five-Factor Model https://bit.ly/gr-jesus
Goodreads Review in progress of Personality in Adulthood: A Five-Factor Theory Perspective https://bit.ly/gr-adulthood

This is no easy task, and I assume it will take me years to figure out how to represent these Big Five "OCEAN" traits visually.
Because our world looks to be totally falling apart here in late May, 2020, and I still have plenty of life left in me,
it's nice to have a difficult problem to solve and take my mind off things.

And as any MBTI (r) aficionado knows, there's nothing an INFP loves more than a mission!
