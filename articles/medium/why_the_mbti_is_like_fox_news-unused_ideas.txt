Why the MBTI (r) Is Like the Fox News of Personality Assessments

The reason the MBTI (r) is like Fox News is it divides people.

One of my favorite aspects of Film Noir is the ambiguous morality of its protagonists.
Modern TV series such as The Wire and Game of Thrones also incorporate this viewpoint.


I am an unaffiliated voter, and my facebook feed is frequently full of two kinds of posts from both sides.
One kind says, in effect, "my guy said or did this or that, which is absolutely correct, so my guy is always right and the other guy is always wrong."
The other kind says, in effect, "the other guy said or did this or that, which is horrifically wrong, so their guy
is always wrong and my other guy is always right."


It's ironic that the large majority of the classic Films Noir were shot in black-and-white!
But that is another story completely.


Two notable exceptions to this world view might be Jesus and Satan -- "might be."
I for one try to refrain from judging others too quickly, because doing so distorts things.
Refraining can be extremely difficult -- and certainly easier for some than it is for others --  but I assure it is well worth the trouble!


As Melinda Potter says at the end of her answer on quora:

[start quote]
Not going to lie. There’s a part of me that wishes to still be able to live in that littler, simple, happier, easier, and comforting little bubble [Fox News] I once enjoyed. But, truth, with all it’s complexity, and unanswered important questions is so much more important to me than comfort.
[end quote]

It's tempting to look at only a fragment of what is visible on the surface, but at best that provides an incomplete view.

Agreeable types like myself find it is much easier to empathize with other people once one understands their motivations.
Disagreeable folks will probably not want to bother.  As the Bob Marley song goes,
"Who the Cap Fits, let them wear it." https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3lT1CivkLo


Freeing Oneself From Plato's Cave


Again, Bob Marley nails it in
Redemption Song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yv5xonFSC4c
"Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery, none but ourselves can free our minds."

Bob's music has been very comforting to me here in these troubled times of late May, 2020, what with the riots and all.

Hello, my name is Tom Hartung, and I want to help others see past the surface.


My favorite questionnaire is the
Keirsey Temperament Sorter, https://keirsey.com/temperament-overview/
but there are online versions, such as the one at
humanmetrics.com, http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/jtypes2.asp
that are arguably just as good.


Now that I am retired from corporate work and can spend all my energy on this project,
this year I decided to step my game up and learn about the Big Five "OCEAN" personality types.

So far I have read three books about it, and it has changed my outlook on life big time!
