Why the MBTI (r) Is Like the Fox News of Personality Assessments

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator or MBTI (r) is an extremely popular personality assessment.
Looking for the #mbti hashtag, or four-letter hashtags like #infj or #estp on sites like twitter, pinterest, or tumblr yields thousands of results.

The MBTI is based on the personality archetypes that Carl Jung described in his foundational work
General Description of the Types, https://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Jung/types.htm
first published in 1921 and translated into English in 1923.

Katherine Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers developed their
questionnaire https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator
in the 1940s and 1950s.
Building on Jung's theories it separates people into one of 16 personality types.

There is so much available about these
16 types online, https://www.google.com/search?q=mbti
I see no reason to describe them here.

Why the MBTI (r) Is Like Fox

The reason the MBTI (r) is like Fox News is it divides people.

The similarity hit me when I was reading Melinda Potter's enlightening response to the question
"If you believe Fox news is "fake news", did you form your opinion by actually watching different Fox programs or by what you are told by other people and what you have read?"
https://www.quora.com/If-you-believe-Fox-news-is-fake-news-did-you-form-your-opinion-by-actually-watching-different-Fox-programs-or-by-what-you-are-told-by-other-people-and-what-you-have-read
I saw the light when I read the following, which appears towards the end of her account:

It’s an alternate universe on Fox. A happier, simpler, more black or white universe that many fans find comforting.
[end quote]

As a fan of Film Noir and modern TV series such as The Wire and Game of Thrones, which I consider to be Film Noir's successors in many ways,
I have learned this is an inferior way to look at things.
People in real life are rarely totally good or evil, but are rather somewhere in between.

It's ironic that the large majority of the classic Films Noir were shot in black-and-white!
But that is another story completely.

Two notable exceptions to this world view might be Jesus and Satan -- "might be."
I for one try to refrain from judging others too quickly, because doing so distorts things.
Refraining can be extremely difficult -- and certainly easier for some than it is for others --  but I assure it is well worth the trouble!

As Melinda Potter says at the end of her answer on quora:

[start quote]
Not going to lie. There’s a part of me that wishes to still be able to live in that littler, simple, happier, easier, and comforting little bubble [Fox News] I once enjoyed. But, truth, with all it’s complexity, and unanswered important questions is so much more important to me than comfort.
[end quote]

It's tempting to look at only a fragment of what is visible on the surface, but at best that provides an incomplete view.

Agreeable types like myself find it is much easier to empathize with other people once one understands their motivations.
Disagreeable folks will probably not want to bother.  As the Bob Marley song goes,
"Who the Cap Fits, let them wear it." https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3lT1CivkLo

I have no wish to denigrate Jung's insights - which are truly remarkable - or the work of the Myers-Briggs family.
I only want to point out that, when it comes to personality assessments, there is now a better alternative.

Freeing Oneself From Plato's Cave

To drive home the point -- and perhaps connect with conservatives whose goal is to be as free as possible -- I will mention
seeing a parallel here with
Plato's Cave. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave

This quote from a page at Stanford.edu sums it up very nicely:

[start quote]
Seated prisoners, chained so that they cannot move their heads, stare at a cave wall on which are projected images. These images are cast from carved figures illuminated by a fire and carried by people on a parapet above and behind the prisoners. A prisoner is loosed from his chains. First he sees the carved images and the fire. Then he is led out of the cave into ‘the real’ world. Blinded by the light of the sun, he cannot look at the trees, rocks and animals around him, but instead looks at the shadows and reflections (in water) cast by those objects. As he becomes acclimatized, he turns his gaze to those objects and finally, fully acclimatized, he looks to the source of illumination, the sun itself.
From "13. Sun, Line and Cave"
in "Plato’s Middle Period Metaphysics and Epistemology" at

Hello, My Name Is Tom Hartung

Hello, my name is Tom Hartung, and I want to help others see past the surface.

Since the late 1980s I have been using the results of a questionnaire similar to the MBTI (r) to draw images of personalities.
I have a program that uses the results of any questionnaire based on the Jungian Archetypes to produce an image.

My favorite questionnaire is the
Keirsey Temperament Sorter, https://keirsey.com/temperament-overview/
but there are online versions, such as the one at
humanmetrics.com, http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/jtypes2.asp
that are arguably just as good.

As you can see from my sites,
artsyvisions.com https://www.artsyvisions.com/
seeourminds.com https://www.seeourminds.com/
and
groja.com https://www.groja.com/
these images are crude.

Now that I am retired from corporate work and can spend all my energy on this project,
this year I decided to step my game up and learn about the Big Five "OCEAN" personality types.

Compared to the MBTI (r), the Five Factor Model is a real eye-opener!
So far I have read three books about it, and it has changed my outlook on life big time!

[Book reviews]

This is no easy task, and I assume it will take me years to figure out how to represent these Big Five "OCEAN" traits visually.
Because our world is falling apart here in June, 2020, and I still have plenty of life left in me, it's nice to have a difficult problem to solve.

And as any MBTI (r) aficionado knows, there's nothing an INFP loves more than a mission!
