Why the MBTI Is the Fox News of Personality Assessments
The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator or MBTI (r) is an extremely popular personality assessment. It is based on the personality archetypes Carl Jung describes in his foundational work General Description of the Types, first published in German in 1921 and translated into English in 1923.
The MBTI
The MBTI is an extremely popular personality assessment. Searching for the #mbti hastag, or four-letter hashtags like #enfj or #istp on social networking sites like twitter and tumblr can easily yield thousands of results.
Katherine Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers had an interest in personalities in general and Carl Jung's work in particular. In the 1940s and 1950s they developed their questionnaire, which builds on Jung's theories to separate people into one of sixteen personality types.
There is a great deal of information about these sixteen types online, so I see no reason to describe them here.
Sanity Check
Of course there are many ways in which the MBTI (r) is obviously different from Fox News! Nor do I wish to denigrate Carl Jung's insights or the work of the Myer's-Briggs family! 
And believe it or not, I try my darnedest to respect and admir eall politicians and journalists, but sometimes, it's just really difficult.
Rather than dis any very fine people on any and all sides, I just want to highlight one similarity between the MBTI and Fox, to make my point, and move on.
How the MBTI Is Like the Fox News of Personality Tests
The MBTI (r) and Fox News are similar in that they divide people. Not everyone is either-or, some people are in the middle - and this is super-important! This article examines this similarity, and suggests an alternative personality assessment: the Big Five "OCEAN" traits.
The similarity became evident when I was on quora reading Melinda Potter's enlightening response to the question 'If you believe Fox news is "fake news", did you form your opinion by actually watching different Fox programs or by what you are told by other people and what you have read?'
Quoting from Melinda's answer on quora.com:
It's an alternate universe on Fox. A happier, simpler, more black or white universe that many fans find comforting….
Not going to lie. There's a part of me that wishes to still be able to live in that littler, simple, happier, easier, and comforting little bubble I once enjoyed.
Now I feel strongly that, despite what we see in movies and on TV, people in real life are rarely totally good or evil, but are rather somewhere in between.
The undeniable reality of this ambiguous morality makes the idea of good guys versus bad guys in movies and TV obsolete.
This applies to politics as well. As an unaffiliated voter, I dare not say anything positive about a conservative when commenting on a liberal's post, for fear of being taken for a conservative. The same is true about posting something positive about a Democrat when commenting on a Republican's post, for fear of being taken for a Democrat. During divisive times like this, here in the Spring of 2020, I find it's best to just stay off line.
Political neutrality is difficult for partisan types to accept, because their partisanship distorts their perceptions.
The way I see it, neither side is absolutely right or absolutely wrong, and our country requires both sides for balance.
Freeing Oneself From Plato's Cave
For another take on this idea, let's look inside Plato's Cave.
Quoting from "13. Sun, Line and Cave" in "Plato's Middle Period Metaphysics and Epistomology:"
Seated prisoners, chained so that they cannot move their heads, stare at a cave wall on which are projected images. These images are cast from carved figures illuminated by a fire and carried by people on a parapet above and behind the prisoners. A prisoner is loosed from his chains. First he sees the carved images and the fire. Then he is led out of the cave into 'the real' world. Blinded by the light of the sun, he cannot look at the trees, rocks and animals around him, but instead looks at the shadows and reflections (in water) cast by those objects. As he becomes acclimatized, he turns his gaze to those objects and finally, fully acclimatized, he looks to the source of illumination, the sun itself.
Clearly no one wants to be imprisoned in Plato's Cave, yet plenty of people prefer to embrace perception-distorting partisanship over a more realistic, non-partisan view. Not that there's anything wrong with that!
Similarly, many people prefer the black-and-white, two dimensional either-or divisiveness of the MBTI (r), when there is a better alternative.
Writing this in Denver, Colorado  in the Spring of 2020, I am beyond frustrated with the current political situation, so you're on your own there. I mean I could recommend you search out differing points of view, but I doubt anyone would take my advice. Lol as if.
However, I do have an alternative to the MBTI that I would like to share.
Freeing Yourself From the MBTI
Since the late 1980s I have been using the results of a questionnaire called the
Keirsey Temperament Sorter, which gives results similar to the MBTI, to draw images of personalities. I have a program that uses the results of any questionnaire based on the Jungian Archetypes to produce an image.
