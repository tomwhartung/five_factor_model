My favorite Big Five "OCEAN" questionnaire is at
bigfive-test.com. https://bigfive-test.com/
It is very responsive and contains a nice, Goldilocks-y 120 questions -- not too many, not too few -- along with other nicities.
A big reason I like it the best because it gives results for the six facets of each of the Big Five.
Another reason is the graphs are quite pretty.
In additon to the summary graph of the Big Five, it gives you a graph of the six facets comprising each of these scores.
Also, it allows you to post your results to Facebook and Twitter.
Who knows, maybe if you post your results, one of your friends will take the test,
and you will finally understand each other and become friends for life!?!
Hey, it's worth a try!  In my mind you have nothing to lose and everything to gain.

To complete this list I must add

This site does not contain a questionnaire you can answer, but it does contain an open source list or "pool" of
items that appear in all manner of questionnaires.

For someone like me, this site is a gold mine!
