Top Five Big Five "OCEAN" Free Online Questionnaires

The list of the ten or so questionnaires I took is in a file named
list_of_questionnaires.md https://github.com/tomwhartung/five_factor_model/blob/master/online-questionnaires/list_of_questionnaires.md
on github.
In this list they appear in the sequence in which I took them.

The Real, but Non-Free, Deal

Anyone willing to pay $92 for an official Big Five Questionnaire should head to
parinc.com https://www.parinc.com
and take the
NEO PI-R https://www.parinc.com/Products/Pkey/276
as soon as possible.

Written by Paul T. Costa and Robert R. McCrae, the NEO PI-R is the gold standard -- the MBTI (r), if you will -- of
Big Five Personality Questionnaires.
These guys have been working with the Five Factor Model for decades and everything I've read about the Big Five refers to their work.

If you're going to spend the $92, I recommend going in with as little information as possible, to help minimize any possible bias.

The wikipedia page for
the NEO PI-R https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revised_NEO_Personality_Inventory
is an excellent source of background information on the questionnaire, but beware, it is rife with spoilers!

For cheapskates who want something close to the NEO PI-R, I am sure that questionnaire #2 on the list below is very close to this one.

Runners Up

The questionnaires on these are all excellent and well worth your time.
But if you are just starting out or your time is limited, you may want to skip them for now.

- https://psychcentral.com/personality-test/start.php
  - Only 50 questions.
  - Site has additonal questionnaires at https://psychcentral.com/quizzes/
- https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test
  - They really want to sell you a "Full Report"
- https://www.scienceofpeople.com/personality/#personality-test
  - Only 44 questions.
  - She really wants to sell her book
- https://www.outofservice.com/starwars/
  - Disappointed that it gives one match per trait
  - I would expect it to match a single character with all five traits
  - However, anything related to Star Wars is fun!


Honorable Mention

#6: HEXACO

The sixth site in this list of the Top Five Big Five "OCEAN" is not really a Big Five Online Questionnaire.

The
HEXACO questionnaire http://hexaco.org/hexaco-online
adds Honesty/Humility to the list.
Most of the items are similar to the items in the other questionnaires, but it contains some additional items

It's great because it shows you how you score relative to everyone else who has completed the questionnaire.

Answering this questionnaire helps the primary researchers with their work.

If you are interested in learning more about the HEXACO questionnaire, they have a
page in the wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HEXACO_model_of_personality_structure
and a couple of books for sale on their site.

#2: Personal.PSU.edu - 300-Item IPIP-NEO

For me, the more items a questionnaire has, the better the results.
Of course, your mileage may vary!

http://www.personal.psu.edu/%7Ej5j/IPIP/ipipneo300.htm

What the 300-Item IPIP-NEO questionnaire lacks in spit-and-polish it more than makes up for in substance.
And for me, substance beats superficial appearances every time!

Instead of hosting questionnaires you can take, 
The International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) site
links to
a
page that links to 

For more about the IPIP see the section "Move Along, No Questionnaires Here" below.

#1: BigFive-Test.com

My favorite Big Five "OCEAN" questionnaire is at
bigfive-test.com. https://bigfive-test.com/
The site has a very responsive, modern feel and contains a nice, Goldilocks-y 120 questions -- not too many, not too few -- along
with other nicities.
A big reason I like it the best because it gives results for the six facets of each of the Big Five.
Another reason is the graphs are frankly beautiful.  I just love bright shiny colors!
In additon to the summary graph of the Big Five, it gives you a bright shiny graph of your score on the six facets
that comprise each of the summary Big Five scores.
Also, it allows you to post your results to Facebook and Twitter.
Who knows, maybe if you post your results, one of your friends will take the test,
and you will finally understand each other and become friends for life!?!
Hey, it's worth a try!  In my mind you have nothing to lose and everything to gain.

Move Along, No Questionnaires Here

To complete this list I must add

ipip

This site does not contain a questionnaire you can answer, but it does contain an open source list or "pool" of
items that appear in all manner of questionnaires.

For someone like me, this site is a gold mine!
