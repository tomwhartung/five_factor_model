Top Five Big Five "OCEAN" Free Online Questionnaires

The list of the ten or so questionnaires I took is in a file named
list_of_questionnaires.md https://github.com/tomwhartung/five_factor_model/blob/master/online-questionnaires/list_of_questionnaires.md
on github.
In this list they appear in the sequence in which I took them.

The Real, Non-Free Deal

Anyone willing to pay for an official Big Five Questionnaire should head to
parinc.com https://www.parinc.com
and take the
NEO PI-R https://www.parinc.com/Products/Pkey/276

Written by Paul T. Costa and Robert R. McCrae, the NEO PI-R is the gold standard -- the MBTI (r), if you will -- of
Big Five Personality Questionnaires.

It costs just $92 and if you're going to spend it, I recommend going in with as little information as possible,
to help minimize any possible bias.

The wikipedia page for
the NEO PI-R https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revised_NEO_Personality_Inventory
is an excellent source of background information on the questionnaire, but beware, it is rife with spoilers!

Runners Up

The questionnaires on these are all excellent and well worth your time.
But if you are just starting out or your time is limited, you may want to skip them for now.

#2: Personal.PSU.edu - 300-Item IPIP-NEO

For me, the more items a questionnaire has, the better the results.
Of course, your mileage may vary!

What the 300-Item IPIP-NEO questionnaire lacks in spit-and-polish it more than makes up for in substance.
And for me, substance beats superficial appearances every time!

Instead of hosting questionnaires you can take, 
The International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) site
links to
a
page that links to

#1: BigFive-Test.com

My favorite Big Five "OCEAN" questionnaire is at
bigfive-test.com. https://bigfive-test.com/
The site has a very responsive, modern feel and contains a nice, Goldilocks-y 120 questions -- not too many, not too few -- along
with other nicities.
A big reason I like it the best because it gives results for the six facets of each of the Big Five.
Another reason is the graphs are frankly beautiful.  I just love bright shiny colors!
In additon to the summary graph of the Big Five, it gives you a bright shiny graph of your score on the six facets
that comprise each of the summary Big Five scores.
Also, it allows you to post your results to Facebook and Twitter.
Who knows, maybe if you post your results, one of your friends will take the test,
and you will finally understand each other and become friends for life!?!
Hey, it's worth a try!  In my mind you have nothing to lose and everything to gain.

Move Along, No Questionnaires Here

To complete this list I must add

ipip

This site does not contain a questionnaire you can answer, but it does contain an open source list or "pool" of
items that appear in all manner of questionnaires.

For someone like me, this site is a gold mine!
