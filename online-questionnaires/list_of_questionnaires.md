A list of Five Factor Model (FFM) questionnaires that I have found online.

# Annotated Links to the Questionnaires I Answered

These are links to the questionnaires I answered for my research into the FFM, along with my comments on each.

1. [psychcentral.com](https://psychcentral.com/personality-test/start.php)
-  50 questions, should take about 7 minutes
-  Says it is similar to the MBTI but actually measures the big five personality attributes
-  See screenshot of results in this directory

2. [truity.com](https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test)
-  "See exactly how you score for [OCEAN traits] with this scientific personality assessment."
-  See screenshot of results in this directory

3. [openpsychometrics.org](https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/)
-  50 questions, should take 3-8 minutes to complete
-  Answered a few other questionnaires on this site, out of curiosity and for fun
   -  See screenshots of results in this directory

4. [scienceofpeople.com](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/personality/#personality-test)
-  44 questions, should take about 10 minutes
-  Actually there were 45 questions, oops on them, but that makes more sense
-  This page has lots of helpful information about the Big Five traits and politics, teamwork, etc.
   -  Also, facial recognition?!?  More likely facial expressions. Skipping that for now.
-  To take the quiz, click on the "TAKE THE QUIZ" button near the top
-  Downloaded chapter 1 of her book for free, saved in this directory
-  See email containing results in this directory

5. [personal.psu.edu](http://www.personal.psu.edu/%7Ej5j/IPIP/)
-  Found the link to this site further down in this list, [ipip.ori.org](https://ipip.ori.org/New_IPIP-50-item-scale.htm)
-  Contains two versions of the IPIP-NEO
   -  New short version: contains 120 items, takes 10-20 minutes
     -  http://www.personal.psu.edu/%7Ej5j/IPIP/ipipneo120.htm
-  Also took the 300-item version, see #8 below for results

6. [outofservice.com - Star Wars Twin](https://www.outofservice.com/starwars/)
-  Find Your Star Wars Twin, really just did this for fun
   -  **Based on the Big Five traits**
-  Rather disappointed it matched each trait to a different character
-  The results file contains a permalink to the results
-  See screenshots of results in this directory

7. [outofservice.com - Big Five](https://www.outofservice.com/bigfive/)
-  The Big Five Personality Test
-  Warning: percentages seem to reflect the score, not where you fall with respect to other people
   - The nice results I got from the HEXACO site make this apparent
-  See screenshots of results in this directory

8. [personal.psu.edu](http://www.personal.psu.edu/%7Ej5j/IPIP/)
-  Found the link to this site further down in this list, [ipip.ori.org](https://ipip.ori.org/New_IPIP-50-item-scale.htm)
-  Contains two versions of the IPIP-NEO
   -  Original: contains 300 items, takes 30-40 minutes
-  I feel this 300-item version is MORE accurate than the 120-item version
   -  Some of the questions were definitely rather redundant

9. [bigfive-test.com](https://bigfive-test.com/)
-  Found by following a link on the IPIP site - see below for details
-  120 questions, "estimated to take you about 10 minutes to complete"
   -  Very reactive - three questions per page, with a progress bar at the top that reflects every question answered - unique!
-  "Important!  Save the following ID to see the results later or compare yourself to others"
   -  5ec805799c0db30007ed2251
-  Permalink to results page:
   -  https://bigfive-test.com/result/5ec805799c0db30007ed2251
-  See screenshots of results in this directory
-  **I do like this one the best!**

10. [hexaco.org](http://hexaco.org/hexaco-online)
- 100 questions, "usually takes about 15 minutes"
- Includes Honesty
- Taking the HEXACO-PI-R will cause your responses to "be combined with those of many other respondents and used for research..."

Results are in the `../results/tomh` directory.

**Note: I never pick the middle option because it seems like a cop-out!**
