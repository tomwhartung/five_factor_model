These are some high-level ideas I have for creating my own Big Five (BF) "OCEAN" Five Factor Model (FFM) questionnaire.

# Phases

High-level thoughts about having three phases:

- Phase 1: Use the 50-item sample questionnaire from ipip.ori.org
  - This is free to use any way I want
- Phase 2: Use the 300 items from the spreadsheet downloaded from ipip.ori.org
  - The spread is in this repo, in `downloaded/ipip/TedoneItemAssignmentTable.ods`
- Phase 3: Somehow modify or add questions to the 300 item questionnaire so it can also yield Jungian Archetype results
- Phase 4: ??????????
- Phase 5: PROFIT!!!!

## Phase 1

Work area is in directory `1-ipip-50_item_sample` .

### Find the Sample Items

Find the link on the ipip.ori.org home page to get the 50 sample items

- It is under "Are you not sure how to use the IPIP? A step-by-step, how-to guide"
- Click on "How to format and administer IPIP measures, with a 50-item sample questionnaire"

### Put them in a spreadsheet

- Copy and paste into `copy_and_pasted-raw.txt` .
- Massage in vi to get just the questions and the numbers in parentheses (*)
- Load into Libre Office Calc

(*) The key to the numbers in parentheses:

> The numbers in parentheses after each item indicate the scale on which that item is scored (i.e., of the five factors: (1) Extraversion, (2) Agreeableness, (3) Conscientiousness, (4) Emotional Stability, or (5) Intellect/Imagination) and its direction of scoring (+ or -). These numbers should not be included in the actual survey questionnaire. For further information on scoring IPIP scales, click the following link: [Scoring Instructions](https://ipip.ori.org/newScoringInstructions.htm).

The Scoring Instructions referred to above are in the next section.

### Figure out how to score them in the spreadsheet

From the "Scoring Instructions" page (https://ipip.ori.org/newScoringInstructions.htm).

> Here is how to score IPIP scales:
>
> For + keyed items, the response "Very Inaccurate" is assigned a value of 1, "Moderately Inaccurate" a value of 2, "Neither Inaccurate nor Accurate" a 3, "Moderately Accurate" a 4, and "Very Accurate" a value of 5.
>
> For - keyed items, the response "Very Inaccurate" is assigned a value of 5, "Moderately Inaccurate" a value of 4, "Neither Inaccurate nor Accurate" a 3, "Moderately Accurate" a 2, and "Very Accurate" a value of 1.
>
> Once numbers are assigned for all of the items in the scale, just sum all the values to obtain a total scale score.

## Phase 2

Work area is in directory `2-...` .

See how Phase 1 goes, then try this.

## Phase 3

Work area is in directory `3-...` .

Possibly try this later.

## Phase 4

Work area is in directory `4-...` .

?????????????????????

## Phase 5

Work area is in directory `5-...` .

PROFIT!!!!!!!
