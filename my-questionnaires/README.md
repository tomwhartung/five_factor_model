These are some high-level ideas I have for creating my own Big Five (BF) "OCEAN" Five Factor Model (FFM) questionnaire.

# Phases

High-level thoughts about having three phases:

- Phase 1: Use the 50-item sample questionnaire from ipip.ori.org
  - This is free to use any way I want
- Phase 2: Use the 300 items from the spreadsheet downloaded from ipip.ori.org
  - The spread is in this repo, in `downloaded/ipip/TedoneItemAssignmentTable.ods`
- Phase 3: Somehow modify or add questions to the 300 item questionnaire so it can also yield Jungian Archetype results

## Phase 1

In directory `TBD` .

### Find the Sample Items

Find the link on the ipip.ori.org home page to get the 50 sample items

- It is under "Are you not sure how to use the IPIP? A step-by-step, how-to guide"
- Click on "How to format and administer IPIP measures, with a 50-item sample questionnaire"

### Put them in a spreadsheet

- TBD

## Phase 2

In directory `TBD` .

See how Phase 1 goes, then try this.

## Phase 3

In directory `TBD` .

Possibly try this later.
